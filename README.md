# Education-Impact-Research
This program extracts key information from txt files such as a student's full name, major, and hometown for research purposes on students' educational backgrounds. The program is meant to be used after collecting pdf files on the students' information and converting them into a txt file. It then reads line by line to extract the information based on surrounding key words and patterns.

This program also includes a name extraction library using the Stanford Name Entity Recognizer, which is based off of the Python library nltk, to further enhance the accuracy of extracting student names.
